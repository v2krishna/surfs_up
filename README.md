# SurfsUp Analysis

## Purpose: 
Purpose of the use case is to analyse the temperatures of June and Decemeber for all years in the Database. In order to complete this analysis we connect to the SQLite file using SQL Alchemy. Mainly we will be performing the Exploratory Analysis according for following Months:
1. Summary Statistics for June.
2. Summary Statistics for December.

### Technologies
1.Python3.7.6, sqlite 

## Results or Outcomes

### Analysis of June:
  ![SummaryStasticsOfJune](/resources/summarystatistics_june.png) <br/>
  1. Number of Observations for June - 1700
  2. Max temperature - 85, Min temperatue - 64
  3. Average temperature is around - 75
  4. Most of the days temperatures are in the ranges of 73 to 77 range because IQR range is from 73 to 77
  
  
### Analysis of December:
  ![SummaryStasticsOfDecember](/resources/summarystatistics_december.png) <br/>
  1. Number of Observations for June - 1517
  2. Max temperature - 83, Min temperatue - 56
  3. Average temperature is around - 71
  4. Most of the days temperatures are in the ranges of 69 to 74 range because IQR range is from 69 - 74


## Summary
Based on the observerations , we say that in the surfing can happen more because of the temperatures where as in December surfing can still happen but it depends of the other factors too. The min and max temperatures will support this decision.

We need to do some more exploratory analysis on the station level compare which stations have similar range temperatures during June / December which is convienient for surfing.
